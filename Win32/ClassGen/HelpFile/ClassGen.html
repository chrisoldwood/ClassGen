<h3 align="center">Class Generator v2.0</h3>

<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h5>Introduction</h5>

<p>
Class Generator is a tool for creating the skeleton of a new class. It does
this by transforming template files into the real class files by performing
text substitutions denoted by special strings, e.g. ${Class}. The tool comes
with the templates that I use for generating C++ classes, although it is not
C++ specific and there are templates for generating non-class based files.
</p><p>
There are two main concepts - Templates and Components. Templates are the
files that are transformed to create the final skeleton.
The tool also supports the concept of Components which are a collection of
common settings that make it easier to generate a class for a specific library
or application. The classes of a Component generally live in the same folder
and are defined in the same namespace.
</p><p>
Configuration is done manually by editing the Templates.ini file. This file,
which must reside in the same folder as the executable, tells Class Generator
what templates and components are available and also some other common settings.
</p>

<h5>Using Class Generator</h5>

<p>
It is easy to use Class Generator, the difficulty lies in the configuration
which is manual. However, once you have configured it, just fire up the tool
and you'll see a dialog like the one below. Just select the component from the
dropdown, which will default the folder and namespace, select the class type
from the template and enter the class name. Then press "Generate" to create the
source files.

<a name="TemplateConfiguration"></a>
<h5>Template Configuration</h5>

<p>
The Templates part defines the types of skeleton classes that can be
generated. The actual [Templates] section lists the template names, while the
template definitions are then provided separately afterwards, e.g.
</p>
<pre>
[Templates]
Path=.
Count=2
Template[0]=Generic
Template[1]=Interface
</pre>
<p>
The 'Path' entry determines where the actual template files live. By default they
are installed alongside the executable, but you could place them on a network
share and change the Path accordingly.
</p><p>
Each template definition lives in its own section, which is created by appending
the word 'Template' to the name. The section has 4 entries, e.g.
</p>
<pre>
[Generic Template]
Description=Full header & source file class declaration
Class=True
HPP=Generic.hpp
CPP=Generic.cpp
</pre>
<p>
The 'Description' entry provides a useful hint and is displayed under the list
of templates that are available. The 'Class' entry is a flag that signals if
the definition is for a class or not. In reality this just disables the Class
Name field on the dialog. The final two entries, 'HPP' and 'CPP', define the
files which contain the outline. Either of these two entries can be left blank
(e.g. see the Interface template) where you only need one or other file.
</p>

<a name="ComponentConfiguration"></a>
<h5>Component Configuration</h5>

<p>
The Components section allows you to define common projects, such as libraries
or applications, where you are likely to create many classes. This means that
just by selecting the component in the UI you will automatically select the directory
where the class will be created and apply the right namespace. The [Components]
section uses the same format as the [Templates] one above, in that you specify a
list of Component names and then provide the definitions in a separate section
later, e.g.
</p>
<pre>
[Components]
Count=2
Component[0]=Application
Component[1]=Library
</pre>
<p>
Each component definition lives in its own section, which is created by appending
the word 'Component' to the name. The section has 5 entries, e.g.
</p>
<pre>
[Library Component]
Description=The library
Include=StdAfx.h
Comment=The Library
Namespace=lib
Folder=C:\Library
</pre>
<p>
The 'Description' entry provides a useful hint and is displayed under the list
of components that are available in the UI. The 'Folder' is the default location where
new classes should be generated and can be overridden in the UI. The 'Include',
'Comment' and 'Namespace' entries are parameters that can be applied to the
template file and are explained in detail further down.
</p>

<a name="OtherOptions"></a>
<h5>Other Configuration Options</h5>

<p>
There are a few other miscellaneous settings that can be configured, e.g.
</p>
<pre>
[General]
HppExt=.hpp
CppExt=.cpp
Author=The Author
</pre>
<p>
The 'HppExt' and 'CppExt' entries allow you to choose what the default file
extension will be for the header and source filenames when they are
generated in the UI - I use .hpp and .cpp, but you may prefer .h and .cxx.
The 'Author' entry is mapped directly onto the ${Author} parameter explained
below.
</p>

<a name="Placeholders"></a>
<h5>Template File Placeholders</h5>

<p>
The template files consist of normal text with placeholders used to define
where certain strings should be applied. These placeholders are denoted by a
string enclosed inside a "${" and "}", where the string is the name of a
parameter. Every parameter name can be specified in Mixed case, all UPPER case
or all lower case to have the value applied in that same case. For example, if
the 'Author' parameter was set to "Chris Oldwood", these would be the substitutions,
</p>
<pre>
${Author}=Chris Oldwood
${AUTHOR}=CHRIS OLDWOOD
${author}=chris oldwood
</pre>
<p>
The following table lists the full set of placeholders, their meaning and how
they can be configured,
</p><p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Placeholder</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>${Author}</td>
<td>The author of the class. This is configured in the [General] section. I use
this with the "\author" Doxygen tag.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>${Class}</td>
<td>The name of the class. This can be entered through the UI for any template
that has 'Class=True' configured.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>${Comment}</td>
<td>The comment for the component. This is configured in the [? Component]
section. I used to use this in the file banner, but having both ${Namespace} and
${Component} in the file now has made this use redundant.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>${Component}</td>
<td>The name of the component. This is configured in the [Components] section
and is how a component is chosen in the UI. I use the upper case version of this,
${COMPONENT}, as the prefix for all #include guards to avoid conflicts where the
same class/file name may be used in different libraries.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>${Ext}</td>
<td>This gives you the extension of the file being created, without the leading
period, e.g. for a source file it could be "cpp" and "hpp" for a header file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>${File.Ext}</td>
<td>This is the complete filename of the file being generated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>${File}</td>
<td>This is just the title of the file being generated, i.e. no extension. I
use the upper case version of this, ${FILE} along with ${EXT} to create the
#include guard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>${Header}</td>
<td>The filename of the <i>header</i> file that was generated. I use this in
the source file to #include the class header.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>${Include}</td>
<td>The common #include file used with pre-compiled headers, e.g. StdAfx.h.
This is specified in the [? Component] section.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>${Namespace}</td>
<td>The namespace that the class should reside in. This can be defaulted in the
[? Component] section of the configuration file and then overridden in the UI if
required.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<a name="Example"></a>
<h5>Example</h5>

<p>
The example below is taken from the 'Interface' template that is provided with
Class Generator. The namespace used was 'Test' and the class name was 'ITest'.
The tool generated a single file called Test.hpp. 
</p><p>
This is the template,
</p>
<pre>
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//! \file   ${File.Ext}
//! \author ${Author}

#ifndef ${COMPONENT}_${FILE}_${EXT}
#define ${COMPONENT}_${FILE}_${EXT}

namespace ${Namespace}
{

class ${Class}
{
protected:
	virtual ~${Class}() = 0 {}; 
};

}

#endif // ${COMPONENT}_${FILE}_${EXT}
</pre>
<p>
And this is the code that was generated,
</p>
<pre>
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//! \file   ITest.hpp
//! \author Chris Oldwood

#ifndef APPLICATION_ITEST_HPP
#define APPLICATION_ITEST_HPP

namespace Test
{

class ITest
{
protected:
	virtual ~ITest() = 0 {}; 
};

}

#endif // APPLICATION_ITEST_HPP
</pre>

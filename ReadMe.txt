Class Generator v2.0
====================

Introduction
------------

I use this simple, single dialog based application to generate the skeletons of
my source files from various templates. The templates are based around
generating a class or file for a specific purpose relating to one of my class
libraries, such as a unit test fixture or UI based command class.

Releases
--------

Stable releases are formally packaged and made available from my Win32 tools page:

The latest code is available from my GitHub repo:

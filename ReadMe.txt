Class Generator v2.0
====================

Introduction
------------

I use this simple, single dialog based application to generate the skeletons of
my source files from various templates. The templates are based around
generating a class or file for a specific purpose relating to one of my class
libraries, such as a unit test fixture or UI based command class.

Documentation
-------------

There is a local manual - ClassGen.mht.
